In love there are two things: bodies and words.
Continue to share your heart with people even if it has been broken.
Love is such a powerful force. It’s there for everyone to embrace-that kind of unconditional love for all of humankind. That is the kind of love that impels people to go into the community and try to change conditions for others, to take risks for what they believe in.
To love is to recognize yourself in another.
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow - this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.
Love isn't something natural. Rather it requires discipline, concentration, patience, faith, and the overcoming of narcissism. It isn't a feeling, it is a practice.
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another: Timing is important. Proximity is important. Mystery is important.
Passion makes the world go 'round. Love just makes it a safer place.
I believe in love. I think it just hits you and pulls the rug out from underneath you and, like a baby, demands your attention every minute of the day.

1. BE TOGETHER FOR THE RIGHT REASONS
Before we even get into what you should do in your relationship, let's start with what not to do.

Don't ever be with someone because someone else pressured you to. I got married the first time because I was raised Catholic and that's what you were supposed to do. Wrong. I got married the second time because I was miserable and lonely and thought having a loving wife would fix everything for me. Also wrong. Took me three tries to figure out what should have been obvious from the beginning, the only reason you should ever be with the person you're with is because you simply love being around them. It really is that simple.

When I sent out my request to readers for advice, I asked people who were on their second or third (or fourth) marriages what they did wrong the first few times.

By far, the most common answer was 'being with the person for the wrong reasons'.

Some of these wrong reasons included:

Pressure from friends and family
Feeling like a loser because they were single and settling for the first person that came along
Being together for image—because the relationship looked good on paper (or in photos), not because the two people actually admired each other.
Being young and naive and hopelessly in love and thinking that love would solve everything.

Everything that makes a relationship work (and by work, I mean that it is happy and sustainable for both people involved) requires a genuine, deep-level admiration for each other. Without that mutual admiration, everything else will unravel.

The other wrong reason to enter into a relationship is, like Greg said, to fix yourself. This desire to use the love of someone else to soothe your own emotional problems inevitably leads to codependence, an unhealthy and damaging dynamic between two people where there exists a tacit agreement to use each other's love as a distraction from one's own self-loathing. We'll get more into codependence later, but for now, it's useful to point out that love, itself, is neutral. It is something that can be both healthy or unhealthy, helpful or harmful, depending on why and how you love someone else and are loved by someone else. By itself, love is never enough to sustain a relationship.

What is love? Baby don't hurt me.

2. HAVE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND ROMANCE

You are absolutely not going to be gaga over each other every single day for the rest of your lives, and all this happily ever after bullshit is just setting people up for failure. They go into relationships with these unrealistic expectations. Then, the instant they realize they aren't gaga anymore, they think the relationship is broken and over, and they need to get out. No! There will be days, or weeks, or maybe even longer, when you aren't all mushy-gushy in-love. You're even going to wake up some morning and think, "Ugh, you're still here…." That's normal! And more importantly, sticking it out is totally worth it, because in a day, or a week, or maybe even longer, you'll look at that person and a giant wave of love will inundate you, and you'll love them so much you think your heart can't possibly hold it all and is going to burst. Because a love that's alive is also constantly evolving. It expands and contracts and mellows and deepens. It's not going to be the way it used to be, or the way it will be, and it shouldn't be. I think if more couples understood that, they'd be less inclined to panic and rush to break up or divorce.

In ancient times, people genuinely considered love a sickness. Parents warned their children against it, and adults quickly arranged marriages before their children were old enough to do something dumb on the back of their out-of-control emotions.

That's because love, though able to make us feel giddy and high, as though we had snorted a shoebox full of cocaine, can also make us highly irrational. We all know that guy (or girl) who dropped out of school, sold their car, and spent the money to elope on the beaches of Tahiti. We all also know how that same guy (or girl) ended up skulking back a few years later feeling like a moron, not to mention broke.`;
